## Old Wine for New Bottle - Legacy Bug Exploitation

INTRODUCTION

For the past few quarters, I've been working on developing regulatory testing scripts framwork. Essentially, framework is a set of automated vehicle tests that check whether mitigation are implemented against common threats. This is aims to cover UNR155 Threats and Mitigation to provide a baseline test suite. We plans to expand coverage to include wireless, USB, cellular, and many other in-car communication interfaces. That's where I come in, as a vulnerability researcher, I've always had a passion for wireless and embedded systems security. In the past, I've discovered various bugs, one of the highlights being Rolling-PWN, which affects all models of the Honda key fob system globally. Additionally, my colleague and I found a backdoor-like account in the firmware of an EV charging station from Schneider, which led to a full compromise of the EV charging network. We received acknowledgement from Schneider and later presented a talk at DEFCON.
