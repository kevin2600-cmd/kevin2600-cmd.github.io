## Braktooth Hunting in the Car Hacker's Wonderland

## INTRODUCTION

<p align="justify">
Years ago, a team of researchers at SUTD (Asset-Group) discovered and disclosed a family of vulnerabilities in the classic Bluetooth link manager layer. They released a paper and proof-of-concept (POC) named "Braktooth: Causing Havoc on Bluetooth Link Manager". The paper is very detailed and enjoyable to read, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Bluetooth security. Braktooth is the codename for a set of 16 classic Bluetooth vulnerabilities that can cause devices to continuously crash or deadlock. In at least one case, attackers can remotely execute arbitrary code and erase all data on the targeted devices. These vulnerabilities are present in various Bluetooth chipsets across many manufacturers, including Intel, Qualcomm, TI, Infineon, and others.
