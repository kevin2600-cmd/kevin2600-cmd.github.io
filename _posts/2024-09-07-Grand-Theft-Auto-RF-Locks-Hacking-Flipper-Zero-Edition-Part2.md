## Grand Theft Auto – RF Locks Hacking Flipper-Zero Edition Part 2

### 0x00. INTRODUCTION

<p align="justify">
Previously from part1, we have looked at some common methods for hacking fixed-code RF Locks, such as signal jamming, replay, and brute-force attack. In part2, we are going to look at more advanced techniques to hack the rolling codes of RF Locks. This series of articles serves as a beginner’s RF lock system hacking journey, performing lock hacking with Flipper-Zero and other RF hacking tools. I hope each case study will help people get a better idea of what they would need for hacking RF locks.
